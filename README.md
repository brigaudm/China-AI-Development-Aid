# China-AI-Development-Aid
Data analysis and visualisation of Chinese government artificial intelligence foreign aid projects in low- and middle-income countries

I used pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to analyse and visualize data from AidData and the RAND Corporation's Chinese AI Exports Database. 

Scroll all the way to the bottom of the notebook to see the two visualisations!
